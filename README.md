Library management system.
Built a full-featured Library Management System with Java Swing for GUI, JPA & Hibernate for database interactions, and extensive unit testing in JUnit 5. Implemented user, book, and borrowing management with CRUD operations, relationship mappings, validation rules, and role-based access for librarians and regular users.
